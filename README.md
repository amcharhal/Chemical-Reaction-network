The chemical reactions system is a set of chemical reactions. This system can be derived
from biology, environment, pollution problems. Chemical reactions system gives rise to complicated system of non-linear equations that donâ€™t lend themselves to analytic solution. Also the huge number of these equations increased more the complexity of numerical resolution of
this system.

The approach adopted for this internship is radically different. And consists in modelling of
these reactions system in the form of a graph to implement methods of operational research.
In order to obtain qualitative informations on the behaviour of the system.


The application built in this project is completely on C++. We have implemented many algorithms developed during this research Project by using many graph algorithms.
